## 7. What is the RainbowCity Foundation？



Headquartered in Singapore, RainbowCity Foundation is a non-profit foundation founded by Mr. Kunyuan, which mainly engages in the incubation and investment of the crypto ecosystem. Being a big fan of Bitcoin, Mr. Kunyuan worships Satoshi Nakamoto and dedicates himself to the spread of Satoshi Nakamoto’s great ideas of decentralization. He once put forward the concept of “Bit Civilization” for the first time in the world in July 2021 at the Bitcointalk Forum established by Satoshi Nakamoto. Moreover, he wrote over 50 articles to promote Bitcoin, in the hope of fostering the development of the encryption industry worldwide and practicing the true Bitcoin spirit.

Mr. Kunyuan has had rich experiences in the crypto world. At one time, he was the highest community leader of FCoin, the most influential community exchange in the Chinese world. In November 2018, in a referendum on the FCoin exchange, Mr. Kunyuan was elected the first community committee member and then appointed vice Chairman to fully preside over the work of the FCoin community.

Mr. Kunyuan believes that a super economic powerhouse will emerge in the mankind history in the future; a crypto world which is constructed in the form of decentralized protocols that transform all different decentralized behaviors into a unified economy. He believes it will ultimately become the infrastructure of human civilization and this is in which the RainbowCity foundation originates from this belief.

The RainbowCity Foundation aims to invest in seven major industries in the following ten years, including Rainbow DeFi, Rainbow Investment, Rainbow Culture, Rainbow Network, Rainbow Industry, Rainbow Education and Rainbow R&D. It strives to become a super economic hub with market value worth one trillion US dollars.

#  Project Story

## 1. Inspiration

### The Influence of DAO on Human Civilization

In the past thirteen years since the birth of Bitcoin, countless encrypted communities have steadily boomed based on the belief and practicing of decentralization. During this period, hundreds of thousands of different types of DAO organizations have emerged. They are all practicing the Satoshi Nakamoto's idea of decentralization., thus a new governance modal has come into reality, a series of infrastructure muti-level business structure have been shaped.

Empowered by community users' opinions, decided by the community votes to make a common decentralized sense, DAO organizations are gradually becoming a live and prosperous economic hub.

In the early age of Bitcoin, the decentralized idea had already existed. Unfortunately, due to the high management cost, DAO was quite difficult to apply in reality. The very first organization, TheDAO , proved a failure after it was established on the Ethereum community. However, as  the encryption technology develops rapidly and DeFi prospered in 2021, the widespread application of all types of DAO organization has realized.

DAO is an organizational modal that comprises of smart contracts based on the blockchain concept. In contrast to the traditional commercial organizations, the initiating costs are much lower.

DAO is more than a series of smart contracts, essentially it is a societal organization and network that unite numerous individuals who share the same goal. A simple code of smart contracts can be used enormously different by varied groups of users. All the DAO participants can abide by the fixed rules or can change the rules by collectively making a decision to eventually change the the behaving modal of the organization. All these lead DAO to become more diverse, differential and various. We firmly believe that every individual that participates in the DAO management is the whole spirit and pillar of DAO.

As DeFi and NFT boomed in 2021, the encrypto world are on the road to flourish and the DAO organizations have come to the world's central stage. We all believe that both DeFi and NFT protocols will be built on DAO and all protocols have to be governed by the NFT owners to make them prosperous.

As the encrypted world continues to flourish,  All different types of DAO organizations have emerged in various forms of decentralization. All these DAO organizations are seeking to gain a first-hand managing solution through their own way to stimulate a organizational and systematic innovation. In order to better service these DAO organizations, there come the specific DAO organizations that focus on developing the DAO infrastructure. Hopefully through the development of these tools oriented DAO organizations, the functioning and governance of DAO organization will soon come into reality. 

These tools oriented DAO organizations include but not limited to DAO hierarchical construction, voting system management, proposal system management, rewarding system management and multi-signature wallet management. In this phase , all these applications are built on Ethereum such as Aragon and DAOstack focusing on DAO hierarchical chart, Gnosisi-safe on Multi-sig wallet, Snapshot on voting off-chain, Mirror on crowd funding for creative projects, Tally as governing platform on tracking the voting log on different DeFi protocol chains, Miso as IDO platform on assisting projects to raise funds and Gticoin on providing grant-giving platform for developers.


### The current problems of DAO tool products:

In the last year, as all kinds of DeFi and NFT protocols continue to boom, all governance DAO in different forms have steadily grown. Meanwhile, there came a lasting demand for tools oriented DAO. After a carefully study and research, we found that many tools oriented DAO organizations have existed in the encrypted world but most of them are still in the early phase of development. It is far from meeting the demand for supplying abundant tools and there exist a variety of problems such as:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/01-Near-MetaBUILD-RainbowDAO-Factory/main/pic/RainbowDAO/2-Current-problems.png)

####  ⑴ Single product function

At present, many  DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of single function, and they are far from being able to achieve some complex collaborative work. We hope to achieve some relatively complex collaborative work through the establishment of a series of DAO tools.

####  ⑵. Low expansibility

At present, many DAO tool products generally have the common problem of low expansibility and cannot achieve function iteration and upgrade, which directly restricts the development of DAO organizations.

####  ⑶.Low compatibility

At present, many DAO tool products generally  have the characteristics of low compatibility. There is no unified api interface or unified development document with one another, which can not be effectively compatible, and even more can not realize the role of collaborative governance.

####  ⑷.Low diversity

At present, many DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of low diversity. Most products can only meet some general functions, and cannot meet the diversified and differentiated needs of the DAO organization.

#### ⑸.Low operability

At present, many DAO tool products  generally have the characteristics of low operability. Especially for some novice users, the user experience is generally poor, and it is even more difficult to use these DAO tools.

#### ⑹.Poor innovation

At present, many DAO tool products  generally have the characteristics of poor innovation. Most of them are learning from each other, the functional models are similar, and they have not essentially solved some of the pain points that are common in the DAO  industry.

### Some difficulties in the current DAO industry

The six points above are the common problems of the tools oriented DAO products. All these products can not solve the pivotal issues in the DAO organization industry.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/01-Near-MetaBUILD-RainbowDAO-Factory/main/pic/RainbowDAO/3-Some-difficulties.png)


⑴  How to establish a clear organizational chart while sticking to decentralizaiton ?

⑵ How to enhance the participation of all community members involving in the community governance?

⑶  How to maintain the voting just and fairness and balance the relationship between the Giants and the small Token holders ?

⑷  How to measure the meaningful contribution of the community members ?

⑸  How to increase the operational efficiency and execution when during decentralizaiton ?

⑹  How to massively coordinate the collective decision ?

⑺ How to stimulate the reasonably decentralized financial system ?

⑻ How to establish the DAO income system and the members' motivation system ?


The eight points above are the common issues that we conclude within the DAO industry.  To truly solve these problems, we believe that providing the DAO organizations with the unified fundamental tools is the key to realizing the DAO governance systematically. And originally this is our mission to establish the RainbowDAO protocol.


### The solution of RainbowDAO Protocol 

In the past two years, the RainbowCity foundation team has been in-depth studying the DAO industry. To tackle the six problems in the tools oriented DAO products and the eight issues that exist in the DAO organization industry, we continue to critically think and study. We hope to make a progressive innovation based on the existing products to create the real tools oriented products that meet the DAO market need.

After two years of endless research and study, the RainbowCtiy foundation team decided to launch a smart contracts oriented protocol, RainbowDAO Protocol, in order to resolve the pivotal issues within the DAO industry.

With the authorization of the Rainbowcity  Foundation, RainbowDAO  protocol is a multi-chain DAO infrastructure service protocol, focusing on the creation of the basic components of Web3. Anyone can create and manage their own DAO organization through RainbowDAO protocol, using  all different Web 3 tools-kits and features.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/01-Near-MetaBUILD-RainbowDAO-Factory/main/pic/RainbowDAO/Rainbow-DAO-Protocol.png)

RainbowDAO Protocol is a multi-chain DAO infrastructure service protocol, providing all kinds of DAO infrastructure facilities and Web3 tools-kits for various DAO organizations on different chains. To better serve all types of DAO organizations, we have built a complete set of DAO infrastructure technical lines focusing on the whole DAO ecosystem., including eight categories of more than 30 independent Web3 tools-kits.

These eight categories comprise of DAO Organizational Management System, DAO Token Management System, DAO Personnel Management System, 

DAO Voting and Proposal Management system, DAO Financial and Vault Management system, DAO DAO Fund raising Management System , DAO Marketing and Contributions Management System and DAO ecological tool management system. 

The eight ecosystems contain thirty independent management modules, each of which is an independent Web3 tools system. All modules make up the complete DAO infrastructure technical lines and each module can independently function or can be freely combined with one another through smart contracts. Therefore, all types of DAO organizations' demand has been met in terms of unified features as well as diversity needs and this makes our DAO organizations flexible as Lego come true.

Meanwhile, in the RainbowDAO Protocol, we brought up a new concept of DCV to take it as the center of all DAO tools development. DCV stands for DAO Controlled Value. In this context, value is controlled  by different levels of DAO rather than by certain individual or any centralized entity. Through the governing contracts of DAO,  DAO controls every core parameter and decision switch in the protocol and it is determined by all governing Token holders through voting to move forward.

Inspired by all these above,  we created the complete RainbowDAO protocol. Driven by this philosophy of RainbowDAO protocol, we will gradually  develop more than thirty independent Web tools-kit systems, each of which is an independent module. Among the thirty systems, the core and fundamental one is called RainbowDAO Factory system which can build abundant types of DAO organizations. Centered on DAO factory, we can build other different tool systems.  RainbowDAO Factory system is our first product submitted to NEAR MetaBUILD Hactkathon.  More importantly, RainbowDAO Factory is also the core part of the whole RainbowDAO protocol.

## 2. What it does？



RainbowDAO Factory System is one of the core systems in the RainbowDAO Protocol and also the organizational management system among the eight modules of the RainbowDAO protocol. More than thirty Web3 tool systems in the protocol are built based on the DAO Factory System. Anyone can create and manage their own DAO organization using RainbowDAO Factory System to create an independent DAO, alliance DAO, parent DAO, or child DAO. A management department can also be created within the DAO to achieve multi-level managing goals.

Now we emphasize the product structure of the RainbowDAO factory and the logics between different levels of DAO. Anyone or any organization can create an independent DAO organization through the RainbowDAO Factory Protocol. This DAO can be called independent DAO which is the basic function of a DAO Factory System. Through the independent DAO, we can expand and scale up in three different areas to make DAO indefinitely scalable and expandable  so that it can hold up to thousands of or hundreds of thousands of users.



![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/01-Near-MetaBUILD-RainbowDAO-Factory/main/pic/RainbowDAO/8-Product-function-display-1.png)

### Product  function display of RainbowDAO Factory:

### ⑴ Scale up: Alliance DAO

An independent DAO can go upwards - join a Alliance DAO  and become a part of it, such as investment  Alliance DAO, media  Alliance DAO, social  Alliance DAO, development  Alliance DAO, etc. Similarly, DAO alliances in different regions can be set as well, such as European  Alliance DAO, Asian  Alliance DAO and American Alliance DAO.

In Alliance DAO management, due to the nature of the alliance, an independent DAO can freely choose to join or leave an alliance without the permission of the Alliance DAO. Alliance DAO have no rigid management or ownership requirements between each other.

### ⑵ Scale Out: Parent DAO and Child DAO

An independent DAO can go downwards to establish its child DAO, like the relationship between the parent company and the subsidiary. Each child DAO is identical to an independent DAO in terms of functional modules but it belongs to this independent DAO. The parent DAO(independent DAO) has the right to govern the child DAO, which cannot exist independently of the parent DAO unless approved by a referendum launched by its parent DAO.

The child DAO is created by the parent DAO, which has the authority to control the child DAO. The subDAO established by the child DAO can be governed by the child DAO and the parent DAO jointly. The child DAO has authority only over its direct subDAO. For instance: A(a parent DAO) creates B(a child DAO), B creates C(the subDAO of B) and C creates D(the subDAO of C). A governs B, C and D. B can only governs C and B has no right to control D. The parent DAO can perform cross-level management on all child DAOs, but the child DAO cannot do cross-level management.

### ⑶ Scale In: DAO department management


Every independent DAO can go inward to establish a management department of its own. In this way, any independent DAO can have its own clear organizational structure. This is also the core function of the RainbowDAO Factory that we have been emphasizing. We believe that any DAO should have multiple departments working together.

In the RainbowDAO Factory, every department established by an independent DAO is equivalent to an independent small DAO and it has various basic functions of DAO. It's just that it is not an independent DAO in nature, but a sub department of an independent DAO. According to our overall product planning, the managing authority of these sub departments is demonstrated by multi-signature smart contracts - a multi-signature committee responsible for managing this department rather than by voting conducted by all DAO members to achieve governance. That is the decentralization mechanism of DAO management, which delegates power to different departments.

In the same way, a department can break down into small departments to further decentralize and distribute power so that the collaborative work can be done through the multiple layers of the department. This is the most basic function we believe a DAO with hundreds of thousands of members should have.

In this diagram over the functions of RainbowDAO products, examples are provided to help you understand the product logics. First of all, we have an independent DAO. In the department management of this independent DAO, we established five independent departments: the Human Resources Management Committee DAO, the Financial Management Committee DAO, the Technical Management Committee DAO, the Operation Management Committee DAO and Investment Management Committee DAO. They are responsible for the specific operations of this independent DAO.

Besides, these five independent departments are divided into different groups to refine the division of labor. Here are some examples: the Human Resources Committee DAO is divided into organizational management group and the salary management group; the Financial Management Committee DAO  into the budget management group and the fund allocation management group; the Technology Management Committee DAO  into the technology development management  group and grant management group; the Operation Management Committee into the brand management group and the promotion management group; the Investment Management Committee into the project review management group and the foreign investment management group.

Most of the management groups above also act as multi-signature management committees. That is also a function of DAO's delegation of power to the subordinate independent departments. Complex coordination is achieved through refined division of labor just like an usual company does. Only with clear division of labor and responsibilities can efficiency and execution be possibly improved.

## 3. How we built it



### Three different versions of RainbowDAO Factory

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/01-Near-MetaBUILD-RainbowDAO-Factory/main/pic/RainbowDAO/Multi-chain-Deployment-Chart.png)



The RainbowDAO Factory System is part of the RainbowDAO protocol. According to our original plan, the RainbowDAO Protocol has three versions: RainbowDAO Protocol Solidity, RainbowDAO Protocol Ink! and RainbowDAO Protocol Near. All of them can be deployed on different smart contract platforms so the DAO Factory System has three different versions as well, which will also be deployed on our future multi-chains.

RainbowDAO Protocol Solidity will be mainly deployed on Ethereum, BSC, Poygon, Avalanche,Fantom and any EVM supportive L2 networks, as well as on all EVM supportive para-chains within the Polkadot ecosystem. 

RainbowDAO Protocol Ink! will be deployed on all Wasm supportive para-chains within the Polkadot ecosystem, to provide DAO infrastructure service for all DAO organizations on the para-chains. RainbowDAO Protocol Near will then mainly deployed on NEAR network, to provide DAO  infrastructure service for all DAO organizations on it.

In the future, as the RainbowDAO Protocol expands , we will develop new versions for other new public chains such as Solana, Terra, Agorand and Cosmos. Meanwhile, as the DAO ecology evolves, we will surely develop DAO infrastructure products that are based on chains and comprise of substrate. At one hand, this would be a para-chain of the Polkadot ecology and on the other hand, it would become an applied chian on the Octopus Network of Near ecology. However, all these chain-formed DAO infrastructure products would be under the development of the RainbowCity Foundation , out of the range of RainbowDAO Protocol.

As to the upcoming NEAR MetaBUILD Hackathon, two versions of the RainbowDAO Factory Protocol will be submitted: Near and Solidity. The former is deployed on the test net of Near while the latter deployed on the test net of Aurora Network. Apart from the contracts' code, we'll also submit the early stage development files and UI design files to showcase a full picture of the product design philosophy and expressive forms to of the RainbowDAO factory.



### The main components of the RainbowDAO Factory contract




![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/01-Near-MetaBUILD-RainbowDAO-Factory/main/pic/RainbowDAO/Factory-Contract-Design-Chart.png)

RainbowDAO Factory system is mainly used for the creation and management of various types of DAO organizations.
RainbowDAO Factory contract can be divided into three parts. The first part is DAO type contract. These types are of independent DAO, alliance DAO and parent-child DAO. That determines the basic attribute of the established DAO.

The second part is the DAO initialization contract, which is used for DAO creation and information initialization and the third part is the DAO management contract for the basic management of the contract after the establishment of the DAO.

The DAO management contract also has the right to conduct management. There are three types of administrators: single wallet address, multi-signature wallet address and the governance token DAO. Generally, the governance DAO acts as an administrator by default, and all governance token holders govern the entire DAO. Managing authority can be transferred between different categories.

The DAO management contract is divided into seven modules. The first module is the DAO basic setting contract, responsible for the set-up of DAO's basic information. The second module is the DAO managing authority contract, responsible for the authority and role management in this DAO and its termination and liquidation. The third module is the DAO member management contract, responsible for the management of members in this DAO, including the entry threshold and the deletion of members. The fourth module is the DAO treasury management contract, responsible for management of DAO's vault. The fifth module is the DAO voting management contract, responsible for a series of settings of voting rights. The sixth module is the DAO proposal management contract, responsible for DAO's proposal management. The seventh module is the DAO department management contract, responsible for managing the department in this DAO.

RainbowDAO Factory spares no effort to achieve upgrading and expansion on the basis of these basic frameworks, to truly evolve into a viable and promising system and become the  infrastructure of DAO industry.

### The three major innovations of the RainbowDAO Factory



In order to better meet the needs of the DAO industry, through the RainbowDAO Protocol, we have achieved three major innovations, which enable the DAO infrastructure to be upgraded and expanded infinitely, and truly meet the diversified needs of the DAO organization.




![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/01-Near-MetaBUILD-RainbowDAO-Factory/main/pic/RainbowDAO/5-Three-major-innovations.png)



####  ⑴ Govern DAO function：

Governance DAO is mainly reflected on two levels. First, the entire RainbowDAO Protocol is controlled by a governance DAO, and this governance DAO is controlled by the governance token RBD. The second point is that each independent DAO created through the protocol will generate a governance DAO which is responsible for the modification of the independent DAO system's parameters.

####  ⑵ Rainbow core function：

The Rainbowcore module consists of four parts, RoleManage, AuthorityManage, RouteManage and CoreManage. The combination of these four functions makes the RainbowDAO Protocol as a whole that can be flexibly rematched with different roles and different permissions. In this way, unlimited expansion and upgrading of the protocol can be realized.


####  ⑶ DCV controller function：

Each DCV is an independent treasury system. With DCV as the core, we have innovatively developed the DCV controller function. Each controller is composed of a series of smart contracts. Through the DCV controller function, each DAO can flexibly control the assets in the DCV. In this way, the management of DAO has unlimited scalability.



## 4. Challenges we ran into



On the road to building our RainbowDAO Protocol and RainbowDAO Factory System, we ran into countless challenges such as:

###  (1) How to organize the problems faced in front of the tools-oriented DAO products ?

Before constructing the whole frame of product,  we put an in-depth effort in all kinds of tools-oriented DAO products within the industry and studied each feature and pivotal point of products to find our own solutions.

###  (2) How to organize the challenging situation the DAO industry faces ?

Meanwhile, we deeply thought about the situation the whole DAO industry faces and brought up our own proposal of solutions. Mastering the industry's law and trend leads to the successful development of the real products that meet the demand of industry.

###  (3) How to organize the logics behind the products of the RainbowDAO Factory System ?

As our goal is to meet all the demands of DAO organizations in the whole DAO industry, the products themselves and the logics behind them must be excessively enormous and complicated. This was the great challenge we encountered during the process of development . We broke down almost 100 product demands and reorganize and reconstruct them to form the logics behind the current products.

###  (4) How to finalize the technical application structure of the RainbowDAO Factory products ?

Once the logics behind the products are determined, how to make the product into reality through technical application was our great challenge. After our team's endless study, based on the product logics, we gradually concluded the technical application structure.

###  (5) How to coordinate between different modules and different contracts ?

As the RainbowDAO Factory Protocol is huge,  the break-down and combination of the protocol became a real problem. How to coordinate among different contracts was also a great challenge.

###  (6) How to maintain the protocol's decentralization ?

The core value of the DAO organizations is decentralization. How to make the protocol decentralized was another great challenge we had. Meantime, many protocols can not be completely decentralized at the beginning, so it needs us to balance the relationship between centralization and decentralization. As to the managing authority of contracts, we set up three administration models:  single wallet as administrator, multi-signature wallet as administrator and governing DAO as administrator. This perfectly balanced the centralization and decentralization. Different phases require different strategies. Ultimately we'll make the complete decentralization of DAO organization come true.

###  (7) How to realize the protocol's unification and diversity ?

In encryto world, every DAO organization's positioning and demand is unique. How to meet the demand of DAO organizations' unification and diversity through the protocol ? This was also our great challenge. We broke down different product demands to make various function modules. These modules can be used independently or can be used in different combination. The free combination makes both the unification and diversity possible.

###  (8) How to add a few unique features to DAO organizations ?

When designing products,  apart from setting up some basic functions, we had to think about a few special features that don't exist in the industry such as  DAO toll, DAO member's recommendation, DAO department management, DAO liquidation and closure etc. All these features were big challenges for us. We tried all our best to build up a complete DAO infrastructure technical hub.




## 5. Accomplishments that we're proud of



In the process of developing the RainbowDAO Protocol and RainbowDAO Factory System, we encountered countless problems as well as great challenges. Thanks to the rewarding process, we had overcome all the difficulties and finally came up with a complete set of product systems to fully meet the governing and fund-managing demands of all types of DAO organizations. In the meantime, our newly developed products not only have eight advantages but also the embodiment of eight principles. These are our greatest pride and achievements. 

### Eight features of RainbowDAO Factory

####  ⑴ Modularity：

Each function of RainbowDAO Protocol can act as an independent module which can easily trigger the upgrading of the protocol.

####  ⑵ Plug-in：

Each module of the RainbowDAO Protocol is very flexible like a plug-in.

####  ⑶ Composability：

Each module of the RainbowDAO Protocol can be combined with each other. Some simple modules can work together to form a powerful module. 

####  ⑷ Scalability：

Based on the modular combination, the RainbowDAO Protocol has very strong scalability and new functions can be added by the addition of modules.

####  ⑸ Breakdown：

The modules of the RainbowDAO Protocol can be disassembled to achieve the simplification of DAO functional modules and adapt to actual needs. 

####  ⑹ Interoperability：

Each module of the Rainbow DAO protocol  can interact with each other. 

####  ⑺ Flexibility：

The RainbowDAO Protocol can be combined, extended or disassembled. This gives the RainbowDAO Protocol strong flexibility. The protocol can be adjusted according to the actual situation of each DAO.

####  ⑻ Growth：

Based on the first seven features, the RainbowDAO Protocol will evolve into a living system that can upgrade infinitely with a decentralized idea.

####  ⑴ Decentralization：

It is the soul of the RainbowDAO Protocol,  well applied to all levels of DAO.

####  ⑵ Trust-free：

RainbowDAO Protocol adheres to the idea of "code is law". All rules are encoded with no need for intermediary.

####  ⑶ Censorship-Resistant：

All rules of the RainbowDAO Protocol are encoded to achieve a complete on-chain governance and the value of all assets is controlled by the chain. 

####  ⑷ Transparency：

The RainbowDAO Protocol realizes a complete on-chain governance. All data are transparently displayed on the chain. 

#### ⑸ Permission-free：

The RainbowDAO Protocol is composed of countless rules that have been set up in advance. They are constructed by smart contracts on the chain. Anyone can use the RainbowDAO Protocol to build a DAO without any permission. 

####  ⑹ Openness：

RainbowDAO Protocol is a set of open protocols and these protocols can interact with internal modules and external protocols. 

####  ⑺ Popularity：

RainbowDAO Protocol can be applied to various types of DAO, large or small. 

####  ⑻ Inclusiveness：

The RainbowDAO Protocol can be employed by all walks of people. We always hope to build the RainbowDAO Protocol into a viable, growing and warm protocol.



## 6. What we learned



Through the systematic development of our products, we have a deeper understanding of the problems existed in the DAO industry and have come up with our own solutions. This is a huge achievement for us. We hope to build a new set of web tools infrastructure to truly solve the pivotal points of the industry and become the infrastructure of the entire industry.




## 7. What's next for RainbowDAO Factory 



RainbowDAO Factory is not only a huge and complex system, but also a great project. We've just taken the first step, building out the top-level design of this product. Although we have developed the code in addition to the Near version and Solidity version, it is not perfect in many functional details, especially in terms of cross-contract calls, there are still more to be done.


In the next stage, we will focus on polishing the contracts, especially the cross-contract calls between different functions. We are eager to launch the commercial products as soon as possible, and to actually deploy them on the main network of Aurora network and Near network, and to start official operations. This is a very difficult project but we are confident to complete it well and build the best DAO infrastructure products.
